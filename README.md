# SysML_KAOS_Domain_Model_Parser
This is the repository for the open source project SysML/KAOS Domain Model Language/Parser

This tool implements rules to generate Event-B specifications from SysML/KAOS Domain Models.

It is a project to implement a DSL under Jetbrains MPS for modeling the domain of a system whose requirements are captured through the SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method: Domain models are built and handled within jetbrains MPS. The editor generates for each domain model a program that will store the specifications of the corresponding Event-B machine at a specified location. The latter will then be executed during the formalization step.
